## The Pitch

Gentleman, here is the proposal and sincere ask, in the name of friendship and I'm going fucking out of my skull.

Think of what you'd like to get out of a 4h session with long-time friends playing bullshit back and forth in a classic "What If..." conversation, except with a theme.

That's right, I want to DM a 5th Edition D&D game over Discord and Zoom like we're a bunch of High Larry's'!

I need some time that's all my own and to hang with people that know me, doing what we do best, play games and eat pizza. I'm thinking none of us really know what we're doing but I've been playing a bit lately so I have a half-a-clue so...

I'm thinking an "intro session" that's a little shorter followed by "The Main Event", with sort of a 30min tail-gate with dice to talk about mechanics. How's combat work, what are saving throws, etc.

In the 1-2h intro we each will have the most fun doing (awesome voices, sly manipulation of your party mates, Inception-level inside jokes, puns up the bun, lots of laughter)
